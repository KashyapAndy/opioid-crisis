# 7.01-hackathon
Week 7, Lesson 1: Deloitte Hackathon

### Prompt
The President recently declared the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency. It has been reported by Forbes that this public health emergency designation makes available $57,000 to combat the crisis. By comparison, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the economic burden of the opioid crisis to be $78.5 billion. **Your team will be responsible for designing a federal program to combat the opioid epidemic.**
1.	Suppose the President declared a national emergency under the Stafford Act and made available $5 billion to tackle the opioid crisis. How would you allocate this money? Be specific.
2.	Suppose the President made available only $50 million. How would you allocate this money? Be specific.
3.	Forecast the impact of both amounts of money by considering the effect on death rate, incarceration, opioid abuse rate, and/or other relevant metrics.

As your team seeks to tackle this complex problem, there are a few things you might consider:
-	Research state and local programs that are particularly successful versus less successful. Identify factors that might affect a program's success rate. Be sure to define “success.”
-	Identify demographic factors that are associated with higher or lower rates of opioid abuse.
-	Are there existing agencies and organizations that might help to facilitate this program?
-	Estimate the cost, effect, and timeline of the federal program you seek to implement.

### Presentation
A five-minute presentation (you will be cut off!) showcasing your answers to parts 1., 2., and 3. above to a non-technical audience. At the end of the five minutes, you may be asked questions.

You will be evaluated by a panel of judges on a score of 1 to 5 on each of the four following criteria:
1.	Data-Driven Solutions (Did the team present solutions backed by evidence and data? Are assumptions and decisions rooted in research?)
2.	Implementation & Feasibility (Did the team create a workable program? Did the team appropriately address logistics such as cost, timeline, and implementation?)
3.	Methods (Did the team apply appropriate methods? Did the team communicate findings appropriately?)
4.	Visualization (Are findings presented in a visually appealing manner? Are the data visualizations clean? Do they clearly communicate the intended point?)

The judging will occur based on your presentation. We will not have an opportunity to review code, etc. before declaring a winner.

### Hackathon Best Practices
1. Get everyone on the same page. Decide how decisions will be made. Use different people for their strengths.
2. Set up deadlines. Add a buffer. Stick to the deadlines as best as you can. For example, make the project "due" at 3:00. Then, when does modeling need to conclude? When does EDA need to conclude? Is the timeline "linear" or can things happen simultaneously?
3. Develop a strategy quickly. It is to your benefit to have a strategy decided in the first hour than to "EDA" toward a strategy for a couple of hours.
4. If the existing data is insufficient, gather more. However, don't spend all day gathering data or conducting EDA.
5. Answer the prompt! A simple complete answer beats a complex incomplete answer.
